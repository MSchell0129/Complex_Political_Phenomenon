## Modeling Steps:
[1] Find the Data
  - Polling data selected
  - _Potential issues:_ Bias of the polling station not taken into account
  - Data exploration

[2] Transforming the Data:
  - Cleaning
    - e.g. - removing null values 
  - Feature Engineering:
    - e.g. -  one-hot encoding and dummy variables (done after retrieved from SQL database?) 
  - Changing Structure and Representation of the Data:
    - e.g. - importing the data into a SQL database
  - Data Exploration:
    - e.g. - Determining features and visualizing the trends 

[3] Modeling:
  - Importing the Data:
  - Aggregation, Normalization, & Scaling:
  - Defining the Model
  - Reviewing Results
  - Model Optimization
