# A Complex-Political-Phenomenon
The M.E.R.S. Research Facility uses massive multivariate optimizing algorithmic models (MMOAMs), a.k.a. machine learning algorithms to predict the winner of the next USA Presidential Election

## RESULTS
The model predicts, with ___% accuracy that ____ will win the Presidential election. Is this model reliable? Read more to find out!

## Modeling Steps:
[1] Retrieve the Data
  - Selected historical polling data
  - _Potential issues:_ Bias of the poll not taken into account
  - Data exploration

[2] Transforming the Data:
  - Cleaning
    - e.g. - removing null values 
  - Feature Engineering:
    - e.g. -  one-hot encoding and dummy variables (done after retrieved from SQL database?) 
  - Changing Structure and Representation of the Data:
    - e.g. - importing the data into a SQL database
  - Data Exploration:
    - e.g. - Determining features and visualizing the trends 

[3] Modeling:
  - Importing the Data:
  - Aggregation, Normalization, & Scaling:
  - Defining the Model
  - Reviewing Results
  - Model Optimization
